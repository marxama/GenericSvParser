# GenericSvParser

Parses csv-like data, where the separator is unknown and deduced from the data.

Made in June 2012, as part of a kind of programming competition a company used in their recruitment process. Was invited to an interview, but unfortunately declined - too bad, they seemed cool.

## Usage

The library is pretty well documented. The main stuff to use are the GenericSvParser.Parse methods.
